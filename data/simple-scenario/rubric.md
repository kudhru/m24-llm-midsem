**Note to Evaluators:**

- **Partial Credit:** Award partial marks where appropriate. For example, if the student attempts to reverse the string but makes minor errors, partial credit should be given.

- **Adherence to Constraints:** Ensure that the student follows the constraints specified in the assignment, such as the single-class requirement and code length limit.

- **Originality:** Confirm that the student's work is original and not plagiarized.

- **Functionality Over Style:** While code quality is important, prioritize the correct implementation of required functionalities.
