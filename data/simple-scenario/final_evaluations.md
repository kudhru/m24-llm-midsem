**Assignment:** Simple String Manipulation Program

**Student's Program:** Implementation of the `StringManipulator` class

---

### **1. Program Correctness and Functionality (Total: 70 marks)**

#### **a. Compilation and Execution (10 marks)**

- **Program Compiles Without Errors (5 marks)**

  - **Assessment:** The program compiles successfully without any syntax errors.
  - **Marks Awarded:** **5/5**
  - **Feedback:** Good job on ensuring your code compiles without errors.

- **Program Runs Without Runtime Errors (5 marks)**

  - **Assessment:** The program throws a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` at runtime due to an error in the loop condition when reversing the string.
    - **Issue:** The loop accesses an index equal to `input.length()`, which is beyond the valid index range.
  - **Marks Awarded:** **0/5**
  - **Feedback:** The program crashes at runtime due to an incorrect loop condition in the reversal logic. You need to adjust your loop to prevent accessing indices outside the bounds of the string.

**Total for Compilation and Execution: 5/10**

---

#### **b. User Input Handling (10 marks)**

- **Prompts the User to Enter a String (5 marks)**

  - **Assessment:** The program correctly prompts the user with `System.out.print("Enter a string: ");`.
  - **Marks Awarded:** **5/5**
  - **Feedback:** The prompt for user input is appropriately displayed.

- **Correctly Reads and Stores the User's Input (5 marks)**

  - **Assessment:**
    - **Issue:** Uses `sc.next()` instead of `sc.nextLine()`.
      - **Consequence:** Only reads input up to the first space, not the entire line.
  - **Marks Awarded:** **2/5**
  - **Feedback:** By using `sc.next()`, your program only captures input until the first space, which can lead to incomplete input if the user enters a string with spaces. Replace `sc.next()` with `sc.nextLine()` to read the full line of input, including spaces.

**Total for User Input Handling: 7/10**

---

#### **c. String Manipulations (40 marks)**

##### **i. Displaying Original String (5 marks)**

- **Assessment:** The program outputs the original string with the label "Original String: ".
- **Marks Awarded:** **5/5**
- **Feedback:** The original string is displayed correctly with an appropriate label.

---

##### **ii. Converting to Uppercase (10 marks)**

- **Correct Conversion to Uppercase (5 marks)**

  - **Assessment:**
    - **Issue:** Uses `input.toLowerCase()` instead of `input.toUpperCase()`.
      - **Consequence:** The string is converted to lowercase, not uppercase as required.
  - **Marks Awarded:** **0/5**
  - **Feedback:** The assignment requires converting the string to uppercase. Please use `input.toUpperCase()` instead of `input.toLowerCase()` to meet the requirement.

- **Displays Uppercase String with Appropriate Label (5 marks)**

  - **Assessment:** Outputs the string with the label "Uppercase String: ".
  - **Marks Awarded:** **5/5**
  - **Feedback:** The uppercase string is displayed with the correct label.

**Total for Converting to Uppercase: 5/10**

---

##### **iii. Reversing the String (15 marks)**

- **Accurately Reverses the String (10 marks)**

  - **Assessment:**
    - **Issue 1:** The loop condition `i <= input.length()` causes an exception.
      - **Consequence:** Attempts to access an index equal to `input.length()`, which is invalid and results in a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
    - **Issue 2:** The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i <= input.length()`, appending characters in the original order.
      - **Consequence:** The string is not reversed; it is reconstructed in the same order.
  - **Marks Awarded:** **0/10**
  - **Feedback:** To reverse the string, you need to iterate from the end of the string to the beginning. Correct the loop to:

    ```java
    for (int i = input.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        reversed += input.charAt(i);
    }
    ```

    Also, adjust the loop condition to prevent accessing out-of-bounds indices.

- **Displays Reversed String with Appropriate Label (5 marks)**

  - **Assessment:** Due to the runtime error, this part of the code may not execute.
  - **Marks Awarded:** **0/5**
  - **Feedback:** Once the reversal logic is corrected, ensure that the reversed string is displayed with the label "Reversed String: ".

**Total for Reversing the String: 0/15**

---

##### **iv. Counting Characters (10 marks)**

- **Correctly Counts the Number of Characters (5 marks)**

  - **Assessment:**
    - **Issue:** Uses `input.length() - 1`, which undercounts by one.
      - **Consequence:** The character count is incorrect.
  - **Marks Awarded:** **0/5**
  - **Feedback:** The `length()` method returns the correct number of characters. Do not subtract one from it. Use `input.length()` directly to get the accurate character count.

- **Displays Character Count with Appropriate Label (5 marks)**

  - **Assessment:** Outputs the count with the label "Number of Characters: ".
  - **Marks Awarded:** **5/5**
  - **Feedback:** The character count is displayed with the correct label.

**Total for Counting Characters: 5/10**

---

**Total for String Manipulations: 5 (Original String) + 5 (Uppercase) + 0 (Reverse) + 5 (Count) = **15/40**

---

#### **d. Output Formatting (10 marks)**

- **Uses Clear and Appropriate Labels for All Outputs (5 marks)**

  - **Assessment:** All outputs are labeled appropriately.
  - **Marks Awarded:** **5/5**
  - **Feedback:** The labels for the outputs are clear and match the assignment requirements.

- **Overall Output Matches Sample Format (5 marks)**

  - **Assessment:**
    - **Issue:** Due to incorrect manipulations and runtime errors, the output does not match the sample format.
  - **Marks Awarded:** **2/5**
  - **Feedback:** After correcting the errors in string manipulations, ensure that the overall output format matches the sample provided in the assignment.

**Total for Output Formatting: 7/10**

---

**Total Marks for Program Correctness and Functionality: 5 (Compilation) + 7 (Input Handling) + 15 (String Manipulations) + 7 (Output Formatting) = **34/70**

- **Proper Indentation and Consistent Spacing (5 marks)**

  - **Assessment:** The code is properly indented and spaced.
  - **Marks Awarded:** **5/5**
  - **Feedback:** Good job maintaining proper indentation and code formatting.

- **Meaningful Variable Names and Java Naming Conventions (5 marks)**

  - **Assessment:** Variable names like `sc`, `input`, `reversed`, and `i` are acceptable and follow conventions.
  - **Marks Awarded:** **5/5**
  - **Feedback:** Variable names are meaningful and adhere to Java naming conventions.

---

#### **b. Best Practices and Resource Management (5 marks)**

- **Effectively Utilizes Appropriate String Methods (3 marks)**

  - **Assessment:**
    - **Issue:** Incorrect use of `toLowerCase()` instead of `toUpperCase()`.
    - **Issue:** Inefficient and incorrect reversal logic.
    - **Issue:** Incorrect calculation of string length.
  - **Marks Awarded:** **1/3**
  - **Feedback:** Use `toUpperCase()` for uppercase conversion. Utilize built-in methods like `StringBuilder` for reversing strings efficiently. Ensure correct use of `length()` for character count.

- **Closes the Scanner Object After Use (2 marks)**

  - **Assessment:**
    - **Issue:** The `Scanner` object `sc` is not closed.
  - **Marks Awarded:** **0/2**
  - **Feedback:** Remember to close the `Scanner` using `sc.close();` at the end of your `main` method to prevent resource leaks.
